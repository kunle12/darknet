# Darknet
Darknet is an open source neural network framework written in C and CUDA. It is fast, easy to install, and supports CPU and GPU computation.

This fork is a C++ adaptation of **Darknet**. It contains code modifications and a CMake based build script so that Darknet can be built into a shared library to be incorporated into standard C++ programs.

For Darknet specific information see the [Darknet project website](http://pjreddie.com/darknet).
